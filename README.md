**_18!_**       _I am fine with young people, and I do not do anything bad towards them. I do not accept anyone younger than me who likes to do something sexual. I am not a P3d0. That's messed up and easily grosses me out if I see it in general. I am not interested in any relationships._

_If you see me in Pony Town, you can freely come to me if I don't have my name next to saying [DNIUF] if you are wondering why. pony town trollers. They always whisper to you privately, saying whatever they want to say, often in a derogatory manner. I do get them a lot lately when I am on. I suggest you not interact with me if I have it set up the DINUF on my name. There's more that you should not copy any of my ponies. I would let my friends in Pony Town copy my outfit if they want to match with me, such as a duo._
